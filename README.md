# Python_Chat_Server
 Crafted a scalable chat server in Python with TCP sockets and implemented client-side threading for concurrent communication. The project employs the select module to efficiently manage and select active connections. Users can access the server via a shell or terminal, and the server dynamically scales to accommodate new client connections. This undertaking showcases adeptness in network programming, threading, and socket-based communication for a robust chat server.

# Note:
Every folder (client & server) has its own README to describe how to work it. It is also important to note that this was created and designed in a networks class at University of Denver so there was some requirements like a single file (which I wouldn't do if I had the choice).
